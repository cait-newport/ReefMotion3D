# ReefMotion3D
ReefMotion3D leverages Structure from Motion (SfM) to create high-resolution 3D models of coral reefs and fish movements. This project aims to advance marine research by providing detailed visual data for studying reef ecosystems and fish behaviour. Features include tools for SfM and animal tracking, and data visualization.
