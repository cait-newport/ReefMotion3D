# ReefMotion3D
ReefMotion3D leverages Structure from Motion (SfM) to create high-resolution 3D models of coral reefs and fish movements. Our goal is to advance marine research by providing accurate and high-resolution visual data that can aid in the study of coral reef ecosystems, fish behavior, and habitat health.

**Key Features:**

- High-resolution 3D reconstruction of coral reefs
- Detailed modelling of fish species and their movements
- Tools and scripts for SfM processing and analysis
- Data visualization and export options for research purposes
- Comprehensive documentation and tutorials for easy replication and extension
